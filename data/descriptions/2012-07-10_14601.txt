Company
Holoholo is a Madrid-based startup that aims to let the world live the story and take gameplay beyond the screen. Holoholo is developing a mobile, location-based, scavenger-hunt style game, but with a storyline. What's interesting about holoholo is that it takes location-based services beyond check-ins and badges. With the use of a fictional story layered on top of the physical world, holoholo will allow the world to experience a compelling narrative in real-time and on location. 
Holoholo is a graduate of the Tetuan Valley Startup School, a winner in the first edition of EmprendeGO in the Telecommunications category, and first runner up at the IE Business School VentureDays 2012.
