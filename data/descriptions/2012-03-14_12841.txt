Our engineers
- Demonstrate world-class programming ability. 
- Build the tools they need to move fast. 
- Care deeply about system reliability, code quality, and frontend architecture. 
Presive front-end engineers need deep knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript as well as server-side and scripting languages. 
We care a lot about user experience, so we are building amazing interfaces that are complex and challenging to design and create. We take the challenge seriously using the best of two worlds: both HTML5 / CSS3 and JQuery to create them.
Expectations
- You have mastered one (any) programming language. We write predominately in Python and Javascript. 
- You have a core understanding of fundamental computer science concepts, specially those related with software engineering.
- You are able to perform basic adminsitration tasks in Linux/Unix platforms.
- You are capable of integrate in a team using versioning and deployment platforms.
- You have built (and are dying to show us) something you're proud of, outside of work/school.
