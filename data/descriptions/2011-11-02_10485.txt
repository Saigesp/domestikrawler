NomadicaBrainstorming.com provides the ideal work situation.  A super cool office near the beach in Barcelona and it's optional.  We work on very imaginative tools to allow people to start and manage virtual, geographically distributed companies -- so our employees can be anywhere worldwide. But weÂ´d like to start off with you being in Barcelona for at least a few weeks.
The OvOsphere web app is a  platform for distributed company management.... it integrates Unity 3D, google Maps, a flexible javascript page configurator, flash/flex video conferencing and chat, and a whole slew of APIs to 3rd party apps like Basecamp etc.     So the web programmer has to have a feeling for the user -experience and be a whiz with javascript/php. We offer a full-time or part-time position based on your needs.  
There's a super cool office but attendance is not mandatory in the long term - we are building tools for virtual companies!  The job will involve travel and has stock options.
