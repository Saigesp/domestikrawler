We're looking for a front end programmer for our projects.
We need a collaborator to help us fulfill tasks related to production, modification and maintenance of websites and web applicationâ€™s user interfaces.
* We look for someone with experience in creating interfaces with HTML5+javascript+Jquery+css and creating interactions with Ajax techniques.
* You should be comfortable with different templating systems and code versioning.
* A keen interest in emerging internet projects and culture would be appreciated. Interest in fashion, design, lifestyle and culture would be a plus.
The collaboration would be on a freelance basis at this stage; although remote working is an option, we prefer to meet you in person and able to work together with you at our office in Barcelona for our project LookRemix.
