I am looking for someone with editorial skills (preferably someone who has worked on non-fiction, biographies, cookbooks, life-story pieces ) to help me edit/give critical feedback on a series of short biographical stories (25 in total) to be included in a Cultural Cookbook entitled "Tales from a Honduran Kitchen."  
The Cookbook includes 25 traditional recipes from the Honduran countryside. The recipes are explained through text and photography. Each recipe is accompanied by a story of the woman who shared the recipe--thus highlighting the source/soul of the project--an attempt to show the essence of Honduran life through the food. 
The aim of this project is to publish the cookbook and use the profits to help fund projects for women in rural Honduras. 
*Preference for someone who has spent time in Central America. 
Requirements: 
- Native English 
- Editorial Experience  (preferably non-fiction, biographies, cookbooks, life-story pieces )
- Experience in Creative Writing  
- Interest in Cookbooks
- Interest in Central America 
- Passion for story telling
