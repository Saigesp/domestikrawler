ROLE:
We’re looking for a CTO - IT director who is excited about travel, technology, and the prospect of improving the world by enabling global entrepreneurship. You’ll work closely with the founders on every part of the site, deploy daily, iterate quickly, and measure absolutely everything.
We don’t believe in breaking down engineering roles into “front-end” or “back-end” distinctions — if you’re working on the website, you’ll be expected to know (or learn) whatever it takes to get the job done. It's probably best if you’re familiar with PHP (with or without frameworks) and HTML, CSS, Javascript, and other core standard technologies of the web.
But...we’re a startup, so being self-motivated, proactive and independent is probably more important than any particular technology on your resume.
REQUIREMENTS:
- A strong programming background.
- Management expertise in a IT department.
- Demonstrated expertise with PHP programming language (and preferably many).
- Knowledge of basic computer science concepts, such as data structures and algorithmic complexity.
BONUS POINTS:
- Experience delivering real products.
- You can get things done.
- Expertise in Building a team and hiring.
- Able to apply best practices in the company.
- Knowledge of 360º areas of an IT department such as: Front end, Back end, Systems, SEO, Human resources, etc in order to lead a team.
- SCRUM experience.
