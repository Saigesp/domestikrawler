Incubio is a startup incubator that helps entrepreneurs to develop big ideas. Our startups specialize in the use of Big Data to create projects that offer business processes as a service.
Our ecosystem operates by offering shared services to help startups flourish and by providing the necessary resources to make it happen. This includes continuous training for entrepreneurs, a network of mentors, finding the best team to get it done and helping with the business side of things. We can even take on all of the costs, find public or private financing so entrepreneurs can focus on what really matters. This makes Incubio an invaluable tool for anyone looking to start a company of their own.
Our companies operate in similar ways, use the same or closely related technologies and have similar customers. The result is the biggest ecosystem related to Big Data startups anywhere in the world
