Company overview:
Clicktransfer is a spinoff setup in 2015 by Monty Global Payments, a Spanish Payment Institution founded in 2004 who operates in Europe’s eight largest countries. Clicktransfer was founded with the main purpose of digitalizing the money remittance business, by developing a powerful and versatile online and mobile platform that allows customers to send money to over 160 countries and over 200,000 payment points. We use technology as our competitive strategy since our origins, designing and developing unparalleled value adding tools for our customers.
