Hello!
We are in need of a developer to code a WordPress website; front- and back-end.
The design will be provided before october 1st and you'll have two weeks to complete the build.
Thus the deadline is october 15th.
You are great at HTML5, CSS3 and javascript/jquery.
You write semantic and well-structured code.
You speak english at at least a decent level.
You work from an office / a collaborative space / your home in Barcelona.
It is a pretty straightforward magazine-design, that of course needs to be responsive (we will provide ideas, you'll execute), and stays pretty much within WordPress core functions.
But you will need to know how to build on a gridsystem like Pure CSS, how to use Masonry (or similar), and how to pull in Twitter, Facebook and Instagram feeds.
We would prefer this setup:
- No need for twitter bootstrap; just use Pure CSS for the gridsystem and handling the responsiveness.
- Use Types or Advanced Custom Fields for you-know-what.
- Use IFTTT for pulling in posts from twitter, facebook and instagram.
That's it really.  If you know how to add nice page-transitions, that's a plus.
Also if you build sites that are similar to what is featured on siteinspire and httpster, that is a also a plus.
So if you got the skills and are free from end-september to mid-october, get in touch.
