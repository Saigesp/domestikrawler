Imagine, for a moment, that you finally found the challenging work environment you were looking for. You’d probably want to work on a high-tech, market-leading product in a red-hot industry.  You’d of course want to be part of an awesome collaborative team but have the autonomy to make your own success. You’d want to hang out with colleagues from all around the globe in a cool office space with sea views - where people munch fruit all day and play table tennis when they need a break.
