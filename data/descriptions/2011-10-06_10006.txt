MUST SPEAK FLUENT ENGLISH
Seeking graphic designers for some relatively simple but labour intensive content development work for a series of mobile apps.
The apps are adaptations of books, so print and layout experience is valuable. Each book is approximately 170 pages long, with each page being a combination of text and  illustrated comic-style images.
Work involves a significant amount of image manipulation based on existing print-based source material, as well as authoring custom XML using pre-defined templates.
All work is done remotely, and all communication is via email, Skype, etc, so you will be working from home (or anywhere you choose). Although not required, an Android-based device is a major plus (as it helps with testing).
