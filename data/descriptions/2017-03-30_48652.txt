Jiuston needs to reach the stars and that’s why we are looking for an expert on front end development.
Jiuston is an expanding new creativity space, a team of people experienced in communications, with international clients. Sometimes we function as an advertising agency, others, as a creative hub for content development… but always, a workplace with good vibes and people looking to have fun doing what we like, while making a living of it of course.
What do we expect from you?
You are a graphic designer full with innovative ideas. Taking care of even the smallest of details. Can work under pressure and “run” when is needed to but also you are able to recognise and dedicate the amount of time a work really needs. 
You’ve had experience for at least three years at graphic studios, advertising agencies or editorial but now it’s time to focus on your true passion…
You dominate the creative cloud programs, also know how to prepare final artworks but the best of all is that you don´t settle only with “what has to be done”, instead you’re always in the pursue of proactive ideas.
What can you expect from Jiuston?
A very, very inspiring work space (Check out our Facebook profile)
Open and very friendly work environment
Full time, permanent contract with all legal benefits
Our support for your personal growth, for both personal or Jiuston’s projects
