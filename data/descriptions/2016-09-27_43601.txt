ABOUT BLUE ORANGE
We are a marketing services business which delivers complete solutions to our digital clients. This means that we work with everything from strategy, planning and the execution for e-commerce sites. 
We typically work with new product launches, e-commerce optimisation, affiliation, media buy and campaign management. This involves web development, branding, copywriting, graphic direction, animation, and we sometimes step out of the digital world to produce photography, video and print material when needed. 
Consider us to be an outsourced marketing department; we make big things happen for companies who have expertise in technology or other areas, but not as much expertise in marketing, or simply not enough internal resources. 
We are a small team of about 10-12 people so everyone matters and is treated equally. We aim to enable every individual to do their best and we celebrate success together. We have a lot of on our plates so we balance that with a positive and pleasant environment to have some fun along the way. 
Our company values are respect, transparency, commitment, responsibility, attention to detail and fun. 
We are in Barcelona because we love the weather, the food and the sea. In our opinion, it is simply the best city in Europe and therefore it was a simple choice to establish our business here. We speak English in the office. Our work stands out from the crowd and leaves a memorable impression.
