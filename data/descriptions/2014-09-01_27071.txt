OTATAA is focused on high-quality tablet-based family entertainment. For developing and realizing trailers presenting our apps we search for highly qualified creative video artists. Your mission may start now, and we are principally interested in a long-term cooperation.
Before sending us any application, please strictly consider the following details:
•	You speak English and can communicate your work.
•	We do NOT search for beginners, but candidates with several years of experience.
•	You need to show us successful reference work.
•	We expect a high level of creativity and productivity.
•	Your skills include After Effects and/or Premiere.
•	Your job covers the entire trailer production, i.e. it starts with creating a concept and ends with the final trailer.
•	You are motivated to be creative in the field of family entertainment.
•	You are open-minded to work from time to time also in Switzerland (e.g. for a week).
Be honest to yourself! Please do not just apply. We only consider applications that include a list of web links pointing to your reference work and projects (having "helped“ in a project does not count and is insufficient). We don’t need any CV at this first stage of your application.

Your employment starts as a freelancer, you get paid, and you will work at your and our offices (in Switzerland). Our principal intention is a long-term cooperation providing all options of making career.
