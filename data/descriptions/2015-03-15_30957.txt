POISON NYC is a boutique design studio based in New York. We have more than 10-year experience in the fashion and beauty industry.
We need a bilingual (Spanish/English) Web Designer and Front-end Developer. Ideally based in Madrid as we are planning to opening our offices in Spain pretty soon.
This is a part-time position meaning you'll be working with a member of our team remotely on different projects. A total of 20 hours a week, Monday to Friday and eventually becoming full time at our offices in Madrid (next year).
Tasks include design proposal for clients, PSD slicing and HTML/CSS responsive frameworks.
Best- 
David Flores
