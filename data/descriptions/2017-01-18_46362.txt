Are you passionate about IT, and want to build cool stuff that has an impact on how people work day by day? Do you get a kick out of developing state of the art software? Are you up for a real challenge to become the best Infrastructure Engineer?
In Madrid we have already established a major tech hub and agile environment to enable us to develop a new innovative and user friendly HR platform solution that will really rock our industry. We have more than 100 software developers, UX designers and professional staff among others. We want to expand substantially over the coming years, so we are looking for committed people who believe in our long term perspective.
Finally, and ultimately most important, we are looking for team members who share our mindset & core values: Smart, Helpful, Conscious, Expert & Reliable.  Are you up for it?
We are looking for Infrastructure Engineer who will be reporting the right hand of the Cloud Operations manager. You will bring a lot of technical infra and operations experience. You enjoy continuously improving team processes and aligning priorities with other teams. Working in and with distributed teams is for you already second-nature: you are excited about our teams being distributed across different continents.
We are looking for a team player who takes initiative and has a getting-things-done attitude, who is not afraid of complexity and enjoys a good challenge. You must be able to handle a fast-paced work environment, juggling several different tasks at the same time while setting the right priorities. You have some experience in managing a small team effectively. Some international travel is no issue for you.
