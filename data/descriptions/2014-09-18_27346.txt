We are working on a collaborative project with woman filmmakers and artists from Zimbabwe. The project is an interactive documentary that has a graphic, interactive musical story world.  We are currently in the second phase of the project and will build mocks-ups and develop visual proposals and layouts for the project. 
We looking for an artist that has skills in drafting images of conceptual spaces, visual stages for scenes that could have surreal elements  - upside down stair cases, exterior/ interior in one point of viewâ€¦ 
Also if you have can worked with pattern, geometric patterns and or collage this could be a plus.
To start ASAP
