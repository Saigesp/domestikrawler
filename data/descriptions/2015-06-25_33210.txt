Monkimun is an award-winning company that makes Language Learning for Kids fun. We create a safe environment for children 2-6 years old where learning just happens.  We're Silicon valley funded and winner of best Android app of 2014 according to Google.
We use a Unity3D heavily develop our own native plugins directly in iOS/Android. We also use run our own backend services on top of AWS services (S3, Route53, Cloudfront, EC2..) and bare-metal servers (OVH/Hetzner).
We're looking for a senior engineer to grow our development team. Unity3D knowledge is required. *Many* years of experience are _not_ required - the most important thing is a well rounded engineer (data structures, algorithms, etc).
Other requirements: High motivation to learn and grow, know what it is to work in a serious (-ly fun) startup (high pace, pressure, attention to detail..). Our mission is to change the way small kids learn languages, this should drive you too.
