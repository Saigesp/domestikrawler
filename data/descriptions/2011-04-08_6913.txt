The Company
BaseKit is a well-funded early stage company that is changing the way websites are created. BaseKit delivers a web-based software as a service (SaaS) platform enabling the creation of dynamic, rich and functional websites &amp; web applications quickly &amp; easily - without the necessity to code. It makes it easy to create dynamic websites.
There are more than 100m small businesses in the world. BaseKit believe every year around 10m new websites are created for small businesses and 1m to 2m web professionals are actively producing websites every year. We wish to become the preferred platform for Web Designers and SMEs to create websites. We have the technology solution to dominate website creation for these two target segments.
BaseKit was one of the winners of Seedcamp in September 2008 (similar to Y Combinator in the US). We closed a Seed round in April 2009 and then Series A in March 2010, with investors including leading London based VCs such as Eden Ventures. A Series B round is in the process of being closed in Q1-2011, allowing faster international expansion.
Role Summary
All of BaseKit's websites are created, hosted and managed using the same BaseKit platform that we make available to the general public via subscriptions. The design and management is done in-house with a dedicated team of designers who have all become experts in BaseKit.
We are now looking to supplement the team with a middleweight designer, who can lead the creative development of basekit.com, basekit.es and basekit.com.br (plus others to follow very soon).
Passionate about web design and with a finger on the pulse of current design trends, the middleweight designer will ensure our audiences (which are a 50/50 split of Web Designers and SMEs) see BaseKit websites as the gold standard of design and functionality that can be achieved with our platform.
In addition, the role will be crucial in maximising the conversion rate of our websites. This means creating user journeys that minimise drop out from the sales funnel, as well as ensuring user experience is as good as they can be.
This is a rare opportunity to join a small but well funded and rapidly growing online business. The management team are very high calibre, incredibly motivated, international and extremely ambitious about swiftly growing a global business that will become as recognised as WordPress or Adobe.
The role will be the 7th member of the design team, will work alongside the Design Supervisor and will report to the Head of Marketing in Victoria, London.
