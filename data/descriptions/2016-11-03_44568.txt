# why we do, what we do
@blended.io we believe that top notch digital services and physical products can only be achieved with a deep understanding in engineering coupled with a holistic take on User Experience. Neither engineering expertise alone will make products and services successful, one needs the deep understanding of people and their behaviour as well as the curiosity for why people behave as they do. On the flip side, neither experience design alone will be able to achieve that. It needs the blended of Experience & Engineering.
