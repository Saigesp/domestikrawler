Company overview: 
Clicktransfer is a spinoff setup in 2015 by Monty Global Payments, a Spanish Payment Institution founded in 2004 who operates in Europe’s eight largest countries. Clicktransfer was founded with the main purpose of digitalizing the money remittance business, by developing a powerful and versatile online and mobile platform that allows customers to send money to over 160 countries and over 200,000 payment points. We use technology as our competitive strategy since our origins, designing and developing unparalleled value adding tools for our customers.
Although relative newcomers to the business, we have fought hard for our customers’ trust and enjoy a solid reputation, especially in Spain. We currently provide our services to Europe’s 8 main outbound countries (Spain, Portugal, Italy, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands) and we are in the process of expanding to United States and Latin America.
We believe the key to success and steady growth relies on our refusal to take shortcuts in terms of quality, reliability and innovation through a smart, technology-intensive process of service. What sets us apart is our drive to achieve the highest quality service for our customers.
