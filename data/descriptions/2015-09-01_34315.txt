Hello,
We're a young and motivated startup out of Barcelona that has developed a SaaS platform to enable brands and online shops to use their customer photos from social media as social proof and increase their conversioon rates. We currently have more than 20+ clients in Spain, UK, US, Netherlands and India and growing fast.
The next step on our journey is growth, for which we are looking to build inside sales (SDR) team. Previous experience in B2B sales is a bonus, but not an absolute requirement. We are looking for people that have the
desire to learn with some of the following skills:
1. Previous customer facing experience (sales/retail)
2. Understanding of the space we are in (Social media, E-commerce)
3. Native English speaker. Great communicator
4. Comfortable working remotely
