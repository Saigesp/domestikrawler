Job Description:
Web designers within TravelClick are required to create engaging and visually appealing web page designs primarily for hotels and other travel related outlets such as restaurants / bars, spas and golf courses. 
The standard design process requires that the designer directly liaises with the client and the sales team in order to understand how the client wants to position their new online brand. Once the design direction is established the designer is then required to produce a series of static compositions of how the new website will look and function. To this end each designer needs to have a good understanding of web technologies so that they can design with these technologies in mind.
