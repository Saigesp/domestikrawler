Our Problem:
We have been developing a financial platform for a few months now. Clients love the functionalities, but the design still needs some tweeking. This is where you come in.
Your profile:
•	You have some experience in web development
•	You love to think about UI/UX and can give your input about how to make an already developed tool more intuitive
•	You can make a complex matrix look like a game
What we offer you:

•	Extreme flexibility. We don’t care when or where you do your job
•	Get to know an award-winning startup from the inside and be part of a young and dynamic team. Call your boss „dude“.
