Hi guys and girls, my team is looking for a freelance remote app UI designer (emphasis on APP) to help us on a project involving the redesign of a mobile app (Android and iOS at the moment). What are we looking for?
 
be(damn) good and love what you do, know both platforms (iOS and Android), know the users and interactions on these platforms. You know your tools. 
 be willing to learn and share what you know. You are a good team player. You forgive mistakes and correct us along the way.
 
 you deliver 
when promised and what you promised (emphasis on WHEN). You do your very best and ask for help when you don't know what to do or are overwhelmed. You work when you want but when you do, you're fully focused on the task.
  you speak English very well, are on Skype and respond to emails quickly. We don't expect you to be online 24/7, but if a programmer has a question you will answer it as soon as you can cause you understand that not doing so might endanger the sprint. Used to answering emails in 48 hours? You are not in so don't waste our time applying.
 you fit well in a team that has no ego and that does not accept bullshit. We have no boss. 
Looking forward to meeting you!
