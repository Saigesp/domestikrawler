about tombola
tombola is a family owned company based in Sunderland (with offices in Madrid, Milan and Gibraltar) which operates the UK's, Spain's and Italy's biggest on-line bingo websites. 
Our approach is different to many of our competitors in that we produce all our software ourselves; in fact just about every aspect of tombola is managed in-house. We have created all our own games and we take pride in our technical innovation and the strength of the development and design teams who use cutting edge technologies to drive the business forward. 
The future of tombola is bright as we're looking to build on our European presence as well as a creating a new and exciting "social" presence.
