We’re looking for a brilliant developer with at least 4 years of experience, and who’s ready to move up to the next level. You should have a well-presented portfolio that showcases the best of your work, and you should be ready to talk us through some of the highlights if we invite you in for an interview.
You must be an advanced Actionscript developer who is experienced with frameworks such as Robotlegs or PureMVC. However you’ll also be expected to have a general understanding of the broader web and mobile development skill-set. Additional skills such as HTML5, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Node JS, Java or iOS development are a huge bonus as it won’t be a 100% Flash development role. Show us what you could bring to the table.
At this level you’ll be expected to have excellent communication skills and a confident, mature and positive attitude. And you’ll be expected to attend meetings with clients, to talk them through the work and to listen to and understand their requirements.
Becoming a Pirate means you get exposed to a huge range of interesting and challenging projects of all shapes and sizes. We’re a close-knit and informal team but we work hard and take great pride in what we do. Craft and Innovation is what we love at Pirata and what we expect all Pirates to have in abundance, regardless of role.
Get in touch if you think you’ve got the skills.
