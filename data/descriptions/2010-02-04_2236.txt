We are looking for an excellent designer. Someone that is willing to help us improve the way we work and the software we make by incorporating design at all levels.
BeBanjo is a small company that is trying to change the way TV and media companies work and collaborate. We are building easy to use, interconnected web applications to manage all aspects of a TV service, whether that is a full fledged Video On Demand service like Sky Player, or a youtube channel for smaller companies looking to put their content in the net.
In less than two years we have managed to build 2 products and sell them to some of the top media companies in Europe. But we are not satisfied. We don't want to build good products; we want to build outstanding products. We want to build products that people love to use, because they are intuitive, because they are simple, because they are beautiful. 
Are you “The Total designer”? Do you think you could be if you were given the right opportunity and environment? We would love to talk to you.
