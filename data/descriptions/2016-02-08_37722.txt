- We build experiences, taking into account where the user is coming from, their expectations and frame of mind. We try to weave a story through every microinteraction and pixel.
- We talk to and observe users, we look at analytical data, we observe the market, and listen to the business needs. Then, we elaborate hypothesis, test them with users, and later with using AB or MVT.
What kind of work do we do?
With so many brands offering the same products (Flights, Hotels, Hotel+Flight Packages, etc), and present in web desktop, web mobile (smartphone and tablet), iOS and Android and… we don’t have time to get bored.
