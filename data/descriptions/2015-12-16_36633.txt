&Friends is a new Communication Agency in Madrid specialized in fashion and design. 
At the moment we are looking for someone who loves design, knows all (or at least is trying to know everything) about the latest trends and has studied communication or journalism.
If you like fashion and design, organizing and going to events, social media, being in contact with press and bloggers, writing and discovering new beautiful brands, we think you will like working with us. We want to become bigger with you!
English and Spanish is a must.
