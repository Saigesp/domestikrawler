Who we are
Ztory is a Swedish startup founded mid 2013 that gives readers access to an ever growing stockpile of fresh magazines for a fixed price each month. Our mission is to give millions of people unlimited access to magazines and help publishers find new audiences.
We started out bootstrapped from the small town of Karlstad in Sweden and now have offices in Stockholm as well as Barcelona. We managed to put together a small team of awesome people, build a product loved by customers and reach a respectable paid member count in less than a year.
We love finding new ways of attracting customers to Ztory and this makes it very important for us to get the right kind of entrepreneurial people to our growing pool of talent.
If you are looking for a high-paced working environment with a lot of laughter and great co-workers who are truly experts at what they do and passionate about continuously learning more, if you like to break boundaries and if you take pride in your work and pay attention to details, you should apply for this job.
