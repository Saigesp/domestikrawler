We are looking for experienced, native writers, preferably journalists who write in Spanish (also from the South American countries), English and other foreign languages: German, French, Russian, Italian, Greek, Norwegia, Danish, Finnish, Swedish, Malesian, Portugese, Turkish, Dutch,  Japanese, Korean.  We need people ready to work as the aut√≥nomo.
We have around 30 writing projects to launch.  Each project means writing/translating 200 - 700 short and but very interesting articles. Every deadline and final price is discussed individually as we are trying to adjust to the needs of our freelancers.
It would be great if they were based in Barcelona and could come over to our office from time to time.
