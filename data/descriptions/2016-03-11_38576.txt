Hello, I am looking for a web developer (if you know prestashop it will take you less time).
Project:
1. migrate existing live prestashop to vps
2. add 5 cms templates (very simple templates : photos + text) (mockups provided)
3. add cms menu in header and hide shop menu on cms pages
4. change css to make the design more simple (black and white / minimalist)
5. migrate back to production
Thanks
PS: I am excpeting this job to take 24 hours x 25 euros = 600 euros. We can discuss the price by the hour and the number of hours.
PS 2: if you need some help at some point,  you have a professional web developer managing the project with you.
PS 3: I have other projects if you are good.
