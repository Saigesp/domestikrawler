Everyone talks about  innovation but few people ever have the opportunity to participate in it.  If you are a young geek/maker/creative, here is your chance.
Our Head of Innovation is looking for a geek/maker/creative who would like to get  his/her hands on VR, AR, NFC and gesture interfaces and who knows what Cardboard is.
You will learn and dominate the  technologies and platforms that others only read about in blogs. Your participation will result  in real world projects that  will make your parents proud and your friends envious.
