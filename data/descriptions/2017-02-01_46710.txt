Thingthing is looking for a great UX/UI designer to cover a temporary need.
Thingthing is a young and dynamic company with the ambition to build the future of messaging. We're based in the heart of Barcelona (Gracia) neighbourhood in the amazing Betahaus building (Have a look)
Today, Thingthing’s simple and straighforward UX/UI lets users easily share docs, photos, calendar availabilties and more while messaging. We've won many awards, been in the press and we're backed by amazing mentors, advisors and investors.
Tomorrow, we believe the future will be one where switching between apps, single-function keyboards and languages will be obsolete.
As a team, we have those values and we expect people we hire to enrich and evangelize them, therefore creating the best working environment possible.
The whole team is looking forward in meeting you!
