About
Here at L Marks, we create and run accelerator programmes to help large corporates benefit from talented, fast-growing startups.
Corporates often find it difficult to innovate from within. Even though their employees are experienced and full of great ideas, the demands of day-to-day operations get in the way. Our accelerators solve this problem. 
 We spend time with our corporate partners understanding their innovation needs. We find startups that can cater to those needs and then we help both parties work together to implement new products and services. 
 We are behind JLAB (John Lewis) and Last Mile Labs (DPD). With more programmes to come this year, we’re getting busier by the day. 
 We’re a small team. 
 We keep it casual at the office - currently based out of Central Working in Whitechapel. We have fun working together and celebrate our success with happy hours, team dinners etc. 
 We pay a competitive salary. You get commission on sales that you help close.
Main Requirements: 
- English: Bilingual
- Experienced in Sales
-International Background
-Career Goals in Sales
