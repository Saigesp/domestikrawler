We are young berlin start up (Ø-age 25) working on an online-browser-game that we want to use to create a website that brings people in whole Europe together to create a *never-seen-before* social fundraising platform. As the concept of our game is completely new to the browser-game-industry we also want to focus on a commercial use of the game-concept to get our work as well as the fundraising platform financed.
At the moment our start up is just at the beginning, we currently count 4 team members. Therefore we´re looking for a co-founder who wants to join our team right from the beginning! You should have experience with in game development, especially with flash programming (html5 would also be advantageous).
Currently we are in negotiations with different governmental funds from which we got consistently positive feedback about the business model so far, so that we´re are positive about the future progress of the application and a first financing soon, by mid or end of April. At the point we also plan to pay our first salaries.
Do you have Experience in Browser-Game-Development? Can you imagine to create your own online-game-website? Do you want to experience europe´s Start-Up epicentre Berlin as an entrepreneur? Then you are more than welcome to send me a message =)
Additionally to the work in a great and funny team, we could offer free accommodation in your own room, so that the start we´ll be as pleasant as possible ;)
