At AIM Sport we have extensive experience in the sport marketing industry. We currently work in over 100 football stadiums and arenas across the globe, providing fresh and innovative digital perimeter advertising solutions to our fast growing list of blue-chip clients such as Arsenal FC, Real Madrid, FC Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, PSV Eindhoven, UEFA, adidas, Heineken, Sony, MasterCard and Audi to just name a few. 
You would be based at our tower-studio in Madrid, across the road from the legendary Bernabéu stadium. In the capital of Spain you will have the chance to immerse yourself both in the exciting city life – serving up the best nightlife, concerts and sporting events around - and in the relaxing life, with spacious and leafy parks to lose yourself in; after all, it is probably sunny outside! So are you wildly creative and passionate about design and animation? You could be just the new talent we're looking for.
