Position Summary:
TravelClick, leader in revenue generator for hotels has partnered with a travel site to help increase its clients visibility. One of this partner’s product requires significant technical requirements for operational processes, specifically the use only one domain name and one url structure in order to process campaigns from all our clients (with variable domain and URL structures). We are looking for a developer with PHP, MySQL and Linux skill set in order to build a tool that will be used as a gateway to encode/transcript various domain urls and url structures into one single url structure and one domain name which will then be redirected to original urls after the click. Various url parameters will have to be identified and understood by this tool in order to redirect correctly to the original page. Our partner will then need to build an engine after we provide the url structure so they can replace the different parameters according to the user’s query. This project is set to last 2 weeks, full time.
