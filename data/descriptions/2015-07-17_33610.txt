We're looking for an experienced JavaScript developer to lead the app development for a digital service we have created with the biggest company in the music industry.
As our JavaScript developer you will work integrated with the rest of the team, defining APIs together with our backend developers, collaborate on templates together with our frontend developers powered by styleguides (example of one of our styleguides http://splay-assets.herokuapp.com/styleguide/).
Oakwood Creative Digital Agency is full service marketing agency from Stockholm, Sweden. We’ve chosen Barcelona for our first satellite office for a number of reason, with the most obvious one being: the talent available there!
This is an exciting opportunity to join and contribute to a renowned digital agency. As one of the first people you will help shape the agency and your own work environment. We hope to have 2-4 people in Barcelona with 1-2 from the Stockholm office on location during the initial period.
We expect that you have:
- Expert JavaScript skills!
- Experience developing large scale applications in JavaScript
- Experience with MVC frameworks such as Ember
- HTML5 and CSS3 skills (plus is you’re used to preprocessors like Less and standards like BEM or SMACSS)
- Good English skills
We hope you have experience with:
Unit testing, task runners (Gulp), version control using Git, running virtual environments and perhaps (fingers crossed) Unix.
We, also, hope that you:
- Are passionate about Open Source
- Are active within the developer community
- Have a GitHub account filled with fun stuff
