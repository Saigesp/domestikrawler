We search for an individual who is passionate about the internet, open source standards, data visualization techniques and front-end technologies, eager to learn and develop a career in the development of engaging and beautiful online interfaces.
The candidate should have some proven experience working with HTML5 and CSS3. Knowledge of grid systems used for layout (like 360grid), front-end frameworks (like Bootstrap or Foundation), and CSS preprocessors (like LESS, Sass or Stylus) will be highly valued.
Good understanding and some experience with JavaScript programming and the use of common frameworks like jQuery, Backbone or Leaflet is desirable.
Daily work will include dealing with international projects, so being able to read and write in English is a must.
