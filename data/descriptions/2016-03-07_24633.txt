OTATAA is a producer of new and highly innovative formats for tablet-based entertainment including stories, games and interactions for the entire family.
We are constantly searching for new talent in the fields of 2D-animation and illustration.
A perfect match with your skills is given if
* you are experienced in Flash/Animate CC,
* you are able to also create frame-by-frame animations,
* you can also develop a storyboard, and will not depend
completely on pre-production made by others
You definitely have to speak English since our team is international.
In a variety of projects you will put your talent into the creation of short-movie-like humorously entertaining animations.
Get in touch with us if you are eager, create cool ideas, and think you have what it takes!
