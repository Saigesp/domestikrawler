Trovit is a classified ads search engine based in Barcelona, Spain. It was founded in 2006 and has constantly grown; it is now present in 38 countries with 5 verticals: homes, cars, jobs, products and holiday rentals. Trovit partners with thousands of property portals, used car portals, job boards and other portals of all kinds to offer its users a complete overview of the market, saving them the time it would take to browse all those different sites. It also offers the possibility to search from a computer, tablet or smartphone, as well as the option to create email alerts to be the first to know about new listings.
