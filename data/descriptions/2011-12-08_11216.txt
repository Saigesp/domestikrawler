Dreamstar Cash is heading into an exciting 2012 and we are looking to expand our current team for our Altea (Alicante) office and also for a planned new office in Barcelona. If you are an agile web developer with an ability of getting shit done then you will fit in just great.
About the Position
We are looking to hire 4-5 web developers to grow our existing team giving you the opportunity to learn how we scaled our high volume sites. We’re also looking to create a separate new team meaning you will have the chance to become one of the key founding members.
You will have a chance to work on both our two main properties (4tube.com &amp;amp; PornTube.com) as well as some exciting new projects we have in the pipeline. We are currently managing around 3.5 million/visitors a day across our network of sites but are looking to grow that significantly in 2012 with your help!
About You

You feel the need to push yourself so have various side projects you do just for the kicks. You are someone who instantly gets on with people, and enjoys meeting new people. Most of all you will know how to enjoy life and will want a company that encourages a fun working environment. 
You will have a varied and challenging day. You will be responsible for creating and executing a strategy to help our existing and new projects of all sizes kick ass.
