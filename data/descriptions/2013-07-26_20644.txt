Chicisimo helps girls decide what to wear tomorrow
Chicisimo is a player in the social fashion space, and we are entirely focused on creating an unbelievable user experience. We are building a platform to help girls decide what to wear tomorrow, and to discover and buy clothes they might like.
The way people discover, buy and recommend clothes is drastically changing. The opportunity is enormous, there is not a winner yet, and UX will play a critical role in this segment.
Why us?
Our culture, our methodology, and the impact you’ll have on people’s lives… that’s why we want you to join our team. But we want you to think we are serious, so here you will find a little bit of data.
What profile are we looking for?
We are looking for a strategic candidate who will be responsible for imagining, creating, testing and refining Chicisimo interfaces. The design and UX are a very important part of how we want to serve people.
Responsibilities:
- iOS: Product Design, UX design, process and flow design, layout, etc.;
- Web: Same as above;
- Seeking to understand, and designing based on understanding. You’ll have a lot of help here, you don’t need to implement analytics, cohorts, ABs, or do user testing, but these will be tools you’ll work with;
- The key is that you have a track record of designing amazing user experiences and bringing leading mobile/web products to market. You need to make things happen. You are a designer.
What´s the work environment?
- Chicisimo is at a phase in which there is a lot of work ahead of us:) Seriously, you’ll work helping create a product that is used by a lot of people. Whatever you build, it will be used;
- Your work will be based on information. And having information will be one of your key obsessions. We’ve gathered a lot of user insight, and we’ve learnt how people interact with different versions of our site. You will learn a lot;
- We all report to all. You’ll be equally dependent, independent, and responsible of your work, as the rest of us;
- It’s you who has to do your job, together with the rest of the team obviously. But you’ll have the support of our investors, and many people in the Internet community. Without them, Chicisimo would simply not exist;
- Don’t worry, you dont have to like fashion. But you have to be passionate about what you do!
What are we offering?
- It depends on your profile and experience. But have no doubt that we are willing to invest in you to work with us;
- Competitive Salary + Stock Options plan;
- Based in our offices in Valencia. But if you are *the person*, we are also happy to have you as a remote worker. We’ll make sure you are and feel part of the team, and have technology/processes to work with remote colleagues.
