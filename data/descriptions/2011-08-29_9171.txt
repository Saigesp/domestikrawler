Spadesocial, a company based in Dublin, Ireland is coming to Barcelona on the 8th of September to 11th to cover the IGB Affiliate Conference in the Fira de Barcelona (Hall 2) at STI Montju√Øc site. 
We require two outgoing, confident individuals to host our show. This will include interviewing guests at the event and mainly being in front of the camera.
