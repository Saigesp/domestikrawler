Selling adverts for a spectrum based ad system. Basically each advert costs $10 so your job is to sell adverts based on a 50% comission. Each advertiser must have a logo and a web address. Please view the website to get a good idea of what you are selling. 
The right person for the job would be someone with plenty of english speaking contacts .. To get the ball rolling. Let me know if you have any questions.
