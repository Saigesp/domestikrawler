We are always on the lookout for great talent to join our Madrid Studio to work on one of our new games in development. From the month of september, we will be actively looking to bring on board an experienced UI/UX Designer.
Our work ethic strongly encourages collaboration, and our production methods are constantly changing to ensure a work environment that encourages all levels of experimentation, innovation, and team responsibility.
Responsibilities:
- Help the team understand what our users/players are interested in and why – research, personas, and working with our existing design team.
- Define problems and opportunities – analysis of our users combined with our business needs that we'll form into stories.
- Create stuff to show the solutions – wireframes, flowcharts, prototypes, strategic design, design thinking workshops, constraints, etc..
- Deliver and follow though – actually launching your ideas which means working with everyone from kickoff all the way through development and getting sign-off along the way (final wires & flows, specs, use cases, error states, etc).
Experience:
- Serious passion for user-centered design and games.
- Highly detailed wireframes that you can show us.
- Both a conceptual thinker, and a detailed designer.
- Experience designing websites, software applications or mobile applications.
- Demonstrated understanding of user interface design disciplines and principles.
- Strong, clean and impactful visual design sense.
- Demonstrated experience in designing usable graphical interfaces.
- Can prototype your ideas – whether high or low fidelity, and can show proof of having done so.
- Knows the difference between a project goal and a requirement.
- Easily adapts and learns new things whether it's a new prototyping tool, design process, or games.
- A minimum of 2 years' experience as any of these roles: UX designer, information architect, visual designer, interaction designer, or similar.
- Laid back, but can work hard to get things done.
- Great attitude and sense of humor.
