Brilliant and passionate web application developers
Ruby on Rails Developers in Madrid / Spain
Just Landed is creating the online destination for the 200 million plus people in the world who are moving country or live abroad.
Weâ€™re looking for brilliant people who want to grow with our project and build a true market leader. Your work will get in front of 2 million visitors a month. We have flat hierarchy in the team and the atmosphere is start-up, not &amp;quot;big company&amp;quot;. Development is all based in our office in Madrid, which has a garden with a barbecue in it ;)
Currently we can only consider candidates who can legally work in the EU
If you are looking for a challenging environment where you can develop professionally and build technology which people use and enjoy, we want to talk to you.
What are we working with?
Ruby / Rails, Python, Git, Cucumber, Rspec, Selenium, Memcached, Squid, Capitstrano, Hudson, Redmine, Google App Engine, Amazon EC2 and S3, and a bunch of other stuff.
What should you already know?
You are not expected to be an expert in all of the following, but you should have basic competence in: Unix / Linux environment, relational databases, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, HTTP protocol, etc. You should be able to defend yourself from different browsers and be able to make a good attempt at conceptualising how UI and user workflow should work for individual processes.
Do I need to know Ruby on Rails?
We are developing on Ruby on Rails, so experience with Rails is preferred. We will consider candidates with a high level of competence in another web development framework. You should have a broad knowledge of programming concepts (classes, inheritance, coding practices, etc) and be capable of producing high-quality functional, maintainable and logical code.
Who we are looking for?
We have several positions open so we are recruiting from senior/experienced developers down to high-potential individuals with little experience. What all candidates will have in common is a passion for software development and a strong appreciation of the importance of the user experience. You have to be able to learn quickly, communicate well and co-operate effectively in a team.
I'm a Frontend Developer - does this fit?
Yes. We have open positions for Web Designer / Frontend Developers. This position does not require all of the programming skills above, but it does require a high level of proficiency with HTML, JavaScript, CSS and extensive UI experience on complex web applications. If you are more of a designer, this is not a fit.
Which languages do we speak in the office?
Twelve nationalities in the office means the common language is English. You should be able to write and speak to a level where you can communicate clearly, but fluency is not a requirement. Knowledge of Spanish is not a requirement.
