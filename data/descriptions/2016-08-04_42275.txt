At Ironhack we are looking for a Lead Instructor for our Web Development Bootcamp who is not only passionate about coding, but also about sharing his/her knowledge with the next generation of developers. 
The Lead Instructor is someone who has a deep understanding of programming and good development practices gathered from his/her educational journey and real-world experience. You need to be a strong communicator and very patient -- youâ€™ll need to be able to explain abstract concepts to first-time developers.
- The Lead instructor will be responsible for:
- Leading Campus knowledge.
- Overseeing the whole academic experience of an Ironhack bootcamp (from student selection to graduation)
- Teaching at our Campus
- Creating engaging content for our Web Development courses that may include lessons, exercises and/or mini-projects
- Managing Junior Instructors (JD) and Teaching Assistants (TA)
- Screening our prospective students through technical interviews and coding challenges
