Stoke Travel is looking for a resident tech-head who is creative, motivated and likes the idea of travelling and working.  Succesful applicant is a web developer, with damm good SEO knowledge...and who is also a bit of a guru at online &amp; social media marketing.  You also don't mind a party in betweeen jobs...
You will be in charge of a few interns...so an ability to manage and delegate is important.  
We are based in Barcelona...but we travel a lot...as travel companies do.  So, yep, you will be working from our office in Barcelona...but there will be opportunities to head down and do a bit of work from our surf house in Morocco, or get some stuff done from our staff house in San Sebastian.  You will be joining us at Running of the Bulls, Tomatina, Oktoberfest...and a heap of other destinations that we don't exactly know where they are at this stage..but they will come...  
We work hard...but we have a damm good time whilst we are at it.  Our work environment is brilliant...crew and customers are young, travelling and having the time of their lives.  
We have a bar in Barcelona where you get cost price drinks (eg. 1 euro a pint).  And there, no doubt, you will meet a bunch of new friends from all over the world.  
Stoke is growing rapidly.  To give you an example, a couple of years ago we had a dozen customers at Oktoberfest sitting around in the rain drinking with us...in 2011 we had over 3000!  Pretty decent party as you can imagine.  
This year we will be expanding through Europe...starting next year, we are going global!  Carnival Brazil sound alright?! Sth Africa? Central America?  Indonesia?  Wherever there is surf or a party...we are going to!  So there is plenty of scope for growth.  
We recognise and reward excellent work...so you will be looked after if you get us lots of extra sales!  How are you going to do that?  
So, in summary, scoring this job will get you:
* Great wage package...industry standard base wage plus incentives...and accommodation possibly included.
* Living in Spain
* Plenty of travel
* A heap of laughs
* Chance to grow with us...we have lofty ambitions and expect you to also.
