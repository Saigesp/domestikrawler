About the company
At WINKO we believe in 3 core formulas:
Passion + Creativity = Fun
Creating new games, building new worlds, inventing new universes is what we love doing. We work very hard to bring something original to gamers. We believe this hard work should be fun, and are convinced this fun will translate into exciting games.
small = BIG
We are still a small team but we have years of experience and very high ambitions. Our plan is to release few games but with the highest quality and a worldwide recognition. We love small devices and are convinced they will one day host the best games - and are working to make this happen!
Our Goal = Hardcore x Quality
Are you looking for pink candies and r§ed balloons? Sorry, wrong address... ;) We are here to create hardcore, top quality mobile games. It is our only goal.
We are located in Barcelona, Spain. And only 10 minutes walk from the beach - so take your swimsuit.
