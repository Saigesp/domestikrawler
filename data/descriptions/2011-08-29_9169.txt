Spadesocial, a company based in Dublin, Ireland is coming to Barcelona on the 8th of September to 11th to cover the IGB Affiliate Conference in the Fira de Barcelona (Hall 2) at its Montju√Øc site.
We require two camera operators to cover the event URGENT. We prefer if you bring your own camera.
If you have any questions, please feel free to email me.
Kind Regards,
Rochelle Lazaro
