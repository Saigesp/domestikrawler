Company and Product Background
Our company offers language training to businesses and consumers. Our award-winning web platform connects students with the best native-speaking trainers around the world. While most sessions occur directly between the student and the teacher via the phone or webcam, the Learnlight platform manages everything in the background, from scheduling to reporting, all of it across multiple languages, timezones and currencies.
Students can log into Learnlight to view their scheduled sessions, book or reschedule new sessions when and where they want, receive trainer feedback, anonymously rate their trainers in turn, expand their learning by completing interactive pedagogical exercises, and get reports on their progress with us.
Trainers can log into Learnlight to view and prepare their sessions, provide feedback to their students, rate their progress, and get reports on their daily activities and periodic payments.
Finally, our internal administrators can log into Learnlight to manage the entire business, including matching students and teachers via a sophisticated coordination engine, scheduling sessions, adding new interactive material for students to complete, and running sophisticated reports on student and teacher progress, client billing and teacher payments.
Product Technical Background
Learnlight is a fast, elegant and dynamic web application running on a stack of .NET framework, IIS, PostgreSQL and Windows Server. On the browser we use advanced technologies to create a fast and elegant user experience, including jQuery and AJAX. On the server we use C# and the .NET framework, with ASP.NET API + MVC for web server and UI templating, combination of ORM and direct ADO.NET for database access, and many open source libraries to manage infrastructural issues such as logging. On the database we use PostgreSQL, with increasing use of custom views, functions and cache tables to speed up the performance of the application.
