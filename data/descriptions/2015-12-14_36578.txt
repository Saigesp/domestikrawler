We’re looking for freelancers to create vectorial illustrations starting from a predefined style.
We have created an identity of our own through our illustrations and therefore seek someone who is able to stick to our style.
Occasionally, freelancers will have to make illustrations from scratch, but they will also have access to a gallery containing objects, characters and sceneries, which they will need to re-use or change as to create new illustrations.
Work will be supervised by our design and illustration department.
