We need a motion graphics designer in Medellin, Colombia to start on a new project. Project will run through the end of the month.
You must provide a link to your portfolio or at least several recent projects to share to be considered.
You will work on your own initially, and when the CEO arrives in Medellin. You will work with the CEO  at his home in El Poblado when designing. A background in text animation and motion graphics design are extremely important. 
Please send a link to your work as well as your hourly rate.
Thank you and great luck.
