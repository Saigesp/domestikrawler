New Relic
Senior Java Engineer - Data Visualization Team
Barcelona, Spain

At New Relic, we provide our customers with instant and deep insight into their application’s behavior and performance. With our SaaS-based application performance monitoring (APM) solution, we have our customer’s backs by transparently instrumenting their application and reporting issues, often before the customer knows that there is a problem. We give our customers as much information as possible to help them tune their site’s reliability and performance.
You'll be part of the Data Visualization Team of New Relic, whose mission is to deliver the self-serve components and services that engineers need to smoothly add data visualizations to their products. As an engineer on the Dataviz Team, you will:
Build the charting service that unifies the way we query for and render charts across all our products while providing product teams with the means to stand up their own charting services for any product-specific charting needs.
Build the streaming service to enable our data visualizations to pull real-time data across our products.
Work with some of the smartest, nicest people you'll meet. People who work here say the problems they work on are enormously challenging, and that the team culture is the most supportive they've seen. 
At New Relic, you will work with some of the best engineers and take on some of the most complex problems in the industry. As a member of Barcelona team you will help shape and grow our European development center. We’re a fast growing software company that cares about our culture. We value work/life balance, personal respect, code ownership by engineers, and experimentation. If all this sounds like your dream job, read on:
