You are the Commander-in-chief of the interaction battlefield: proud of your achivements, humble to admit your fails, honest with your opinions and ready to explain and defend your design decisions.
You have a holistic approach to your work and understand that every piece of a product is related and coordinated in many ways with the rest.
You know quality is fractal and care about those small and vital details often despised as second class interactions or “not relevant” steps by other faux designers.
You are a wonderful designer. And we need you.
