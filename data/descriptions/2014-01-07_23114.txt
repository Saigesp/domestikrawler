About Us
Birchbox was founded in the U.S. in September 2010 by friends Katia Beauchamp and Hayley Barna.  Birchbox helps consumers discover the best beauty, grooming, and lifestyle products through monthly deliveries of curated, deluxe samples that are tailored to their beauty profile. Each box includes a mix of products across categories – from makeup and hair to skincare and body – plus lifestyle extras.  An important trend in the evolution of retail for both brands and consumers lies in the discovery experience.
Birchbox then brings the magic of product discovery online. In the Birchbox e-shop, we sell full-sized versions of every product we sample, as well as other editor-approved products. Birchbox also features robust editorial content designed to educated and inspire consumers: from how-to videos to expert interviews, and beauty news roundups.
Birchbox’s innovative approach allows brands and consumers to connect in a unique and intimate way.  With a highly personalized and targeted profile, Birchbox allows consumers to try the best and latest products in their home, including hard-to-find international or niche brands, and provides a seamless way to purchase the full size versions of the products they love.
Birchbox has helped hundreds of thousands of consumers discover the best new products tailored for them. In just 3 years, the company has experienced rapid organic growth and now boasts more than 400,000 current, active subscribers each month.  In April 2012 Birchbox Man was launched for U.S. customers, and in November 2012 Home items were added to the Birchbox Shop. The acquisition of Joliebox in September 2012 expanded Birchbox to the UK, France, and Spain.
