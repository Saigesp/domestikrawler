HTML/PHP Developer

What we are looking for
We are looking for a HTML/PHP-developer who is interested in further exploring and expanding his/her skills in a creative environment. Standards are important, but knowing how to bend them to the will of a project is at least as, if  not more important for the creation of innovative and high-impact solutions for our clients.
You should have an interest in design and branding and enjoy working in a close-knit team environment. Attention to detail and a logical structure should be integral aspects of your development process. 
Who we are
Code d'Azur is a growing, close-knit team that does strategy, concept, design and development. We create “interactivecreativerichmediadesignsolutions”. We specialize in flash/HTML5/mobile websites / RIA's and work for both global A-Brands such as LG, Smart, Coca-Cola, Supperclub, KLM and McGregor as well as local brands and other companies who require a high standard online presence. We are highly focused on design and pixel perfection along with innovative interactive development. Both are considered essential parts to produce unique and appropriate solutions.
Our projects range from advertising campaigns to product platforms to institutional sites to web/mobile/desktop applications and custom content management systems. Ideally you have a feeling for interaction and design and can discuss the technical possibilities with a designer / team in order to determine the best solution.
We currently have offices in Amsterdam and Barcelona, and are expanding agressively.
