Are you crazy about texturing, shading, rendering and lighting and constantly looking for new inspiring creation challenges? Are you an absolute expert of motion design and always aware of new technologies?
Do you sometimes dream of joining a multidisciplinary team of pioneers based in Montreal and feel youâ€™d thrive amazingly in international ambitious multimedia experience projects? Do you consider yourself autonomous and a good team player?
If on top of all this you have a degree in 3D animation, graphic design or any equivalent, worked in the field for at least 4 years, master any 3D software (Maya, C4D, 3dsMax) then here is your chance.
