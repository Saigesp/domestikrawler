EW is Madrid´s on line magazine in English. It went on line in May 2012 and has established itself as a point of reference for English speakers who want to keep up to date with events and news in the city.  Over the last 6 months the page has organised a series of pop up in English events in order to test the market and leverage its readership to sell tours, trails, crawls & guided walks.

The directors have decided to re-launch the page as a monthly magazine and to sell 8 core tours etc to moneterize the page. This will entail
•      a substantial re-design to address the technical needs of a pay platform/cart .
•      The page has become cluttered and unfocused and the new design will need to simplify the interface, reduce the number of sections, introduce the monthly edition format and a news in brief panel.
•      SEO friendly URLs
•      Mega tags on each page
•      A landing page for each tour , full description,  video wall, order and pay (with a cross reference to , other people who bought this tour also bought..)  check out and pay or save and return
•      Responsive design, adopt itself to high resolution desktops, tablets , smartphones and printers
