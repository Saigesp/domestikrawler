Are you creative? Are you also commercially minded? Have you had at least 4 years work experience in an agency?
Can you speak fluent English? And do you just love presenting and working with challenging clients? Well then you could be just what we are looking for!
We are a small but very active international branding and communications agency based in Barcelona, and we are looking for a fresh creative mind to join our team.
And most important – when you’re not creating concepts – you’re a hand-on designer, doing the usual day to day stuff. 
We work primarily in Russia, Germany and Spain, in the world of destination marketing.

Send us your cv! We’re curious!
