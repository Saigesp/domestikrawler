Our engineering team is based in Madrid, all operating functions are based in the heart of the City in London. Both environments offer all the flexibility and perks that you expect from a small but quickly growing firm.
At our Madrid location, we will also treat you to the following:
On-site chef for lunch
A breakfast kitchen and fruit during the day
A budget for your equipment
On-site gym and sports facilities
Access to personal and professional learning resources
