We’re looking for a front end developer to join our small and enthusiastic team who run Shooting People. We have offices in Hoxton, East London, in Olomouc, Czech Republic, and in Barcelona, Spain.
Who are we?
Shooting People is an online creative network that supports the independent filmmaking community. We are committed to developing new services which benefit creatives across the industry. Members use the site in a number of ways; over 100 productions are cast/crewed per week, advice is discussed, skills and resources are constantly shared. We’re dedicated to engineering new ways to make the industry more accessible through alternative routes to funding, project commissions and new distribution models.
Who we work with
We’re fortunate enough to boast an incredibly talented list of Patrons, including the likes of Nick Cave, Lena Dunham, Matt Groening, Miranda July and most recently Kevin MacDonald. Sitting at the heart of the industry we partner with top UK festivals, institutions and brands including Sheffield Doc/Fest, Encounters, BAFTA, The BFI, Firefox and C4 who all have unique opportunities to offer our members.
