*About Us*
Ubeeqo is a mobility company that provides a simplified, seamless mobility experience to all its clients. There’s no longer the need to own a car to move around. Ubeeqo provides a car just when you need it, in many different modes: carsharing, traditional rental and chauffeur service. We are a fast growing company with presence in several European countries. We are looking for passionate, skilled Front End Developers who want to make meaningful, measurable improvements that impact millions of users.
*How we work*
We work in a start-up like manner and we work in small scrum teams of 4-7. Every team member is encouraged to take full ownership of their part of the platform but also to contribute ideas, suggestions and code to other areas of the business. We believe that features have no value until they are in production adding value to our customers so teams deploy fast and often. 
The tech team is building something that has never been built before so we're always trying to think outside the box.
