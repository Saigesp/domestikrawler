Some of our major clients are international brands who communicate in English, so a good undestanding of the language would be an advantage, but is not an essential requirement.
Competitive salary according to experience.
Only apply if you are fun to work with and enjoy working in a collaborative team environment... ;)

We look forward to meeting you soon!
