We are working on a collaborative project with woman filmmakers and artists from Zimbabwe. The project is an interactive documentary that has a graphic interactive musical story world. We are currently in the second phase of the project and will build mocks-ups and develop visual proposals and layouts for the project.
We are seeking artist/graphic designer â€“ someone who can create images (draw or compose), work with collage, has worked with design of space and text, and has some experience with webdesign for wireframes and/or demonstrating concepts interaction design.
If you have animation experience this is a plus or could be a possibility other specific components.
To start ASAP.
