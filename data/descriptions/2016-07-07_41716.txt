Are you crazy about textures, shapes and colours and constantly looking for new inspiring creation challenges? Are you an absolute expert of motion design and always aware of new technologies?
Do you sometimes dream of joining a multidisciplinary team of pioneers based in Montreal and feel youâ€™d thrive amazingly in international ambitious multimedia experience projects? Do you consider yourself autonomous and a good team player?
If on top of all this you have a degree in 2D/3D animation, graphic design or any equivalent, worked in the field for at least 4 years, master After Effects and C4D then here is your chance.
