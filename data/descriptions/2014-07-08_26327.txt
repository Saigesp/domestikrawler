We are looking at rebuilding our existing  wordpress site.
We need to copy and paste our existing 500 page site to a new theme template to maximise on responsiveness, and to clean our existing site as it has lots of unwanted plug ins and history.
We need someone who can manage this rebuild from start to finish.
Is this you? Are you an expert in Word Press. Do you have at least 2 years recent experience designing and building modern sites within Word Press?
